<h5> I have specialized in Retail and Management in the Food and Beverage Industry for
over 10 years! In regards to Software Engineering it's been a great
transitional career move, in addition to my previous degree in Fashion Marketing and Communications. I bet your
wondering how they relate.
Fashion Marketing isn't always about selling clothes, it literally takes the user story, finds out what it needs
then implements the code to deliver
the best outcome for the user. No pun intended.
</h5>

<h5>
Today people are more likely to shop online than in stores, for more reason than one of course. This opens up
a world of Marketing that caters to people in their
home, car, or anywhere for that matter. I've been in Marketing for 16. I've always been a strong seller. I
went from working High-End Retail to the Hospitality Industry where I quickly became General Manager
for some of Atlanta's most Popular Restaurants, Bars, and Lounges. Easy to say I'm a "Peoples Person" and I
absolutely love to cater to others.
</h5>

<h5>
It was not until I started working in Food and Beverage I truly understood the meaning of "Marketing" Once you
understand that, you can sell anything.
Consumers have taught me alot. We as a people are always being sold something, sometimes we dont even realize
it and thats what you call a Great Seller.
A seller can be anyone or thing. And with the world today Technology will eventually outsale us all. If we
tell it to...
Planning to use the knowledge I gain here to land a job in Marketing development/ Software Engineer to create
some of the most captivating sites EVER.
